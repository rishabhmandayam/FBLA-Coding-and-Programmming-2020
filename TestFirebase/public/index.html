The filter method takes a function as its argument and 'tests' each element in the larger, original array. Some condition specified in the test function is either true/false. This gets returned. When it's returned as true, the element 'makes it' into the output array.
          let features = ['auth', 'database', 'messaging', 'storage'].filter(feature => typeof app[feature] === 'function'); //with use of arrow functions here: feature is an argument. The function body follows the fat arrow. The body looks at the typeof app[feature] which I presume will be returned as the string "undefined" if the feature is not loaded. "undefined" when stringly compared (operands are of same type and have same contents ie. ===) to "function" will return false

          //Otherwise, after a single signin we will default to authenticating with the same Google account unless in another browser tab we visit gmail etc. and logout the google user Otherwise
          //Basically, when we use firebase sign out we don't actually log the user out of their gmail. This can't be done with firebase

      //https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth
      //The relationship between Google signin and Firebase auth SDK is confusing. One doesn't substtitute for the other. Firebase Auth can handle many authentication workflows such as uname and password registration. Signing in with Google or Facebook. Twitter etc. is just one way.
      //This post may help, although a littel dated: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25442786/what-is-the-difference-between-google-identity-toolkit-google-oaauth-firebase
      //Keep in mind that signin in with Google is an oAuth2 workflow that can be implemented manually in many environments. Firebase auth SDK has a way of handling that workflow that is streamlined. It only works for web-based apps built on firebase. So if you were using Google Signin from Node, for example, you would have to role the workflow manually.
      //Our options are many ie:
      /*
        1.  Use firebase auth sdk with username and email registration etc.            #Not bad but why bother when we have Google Signin
        2.  Use firebase auth with Google Signin (Google authenticate your identity)   #Maybe easiest. But keep in mind that Maybe we still need to register users somehow in our Firebase DB althought there may be no reason to need to do that
        2a. Same as above but also use FirebaseUI for drop-in UI                       #https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui
        3.  use firebase auth SDK with some other id provider (Facebook etc.)          #Why bother?
        4.  Use Google Signin (or Facebook etc.) and role out own oAuth2 workflow      #Might be interesting as a learning experince. But we have Firebase auth sdk
        5.  Role our own registration and signin with uname and email                  #Ugh

      //This would not be the case if the db access security layer was protected by our own server. We could keep logic server side as with Firebase "admin" usage
